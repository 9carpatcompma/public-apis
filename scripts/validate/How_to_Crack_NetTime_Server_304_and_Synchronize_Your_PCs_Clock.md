## Step 3: Crack NetTime Server 3.04
 
The final step is to crack NetTime Server 3.04 and bypass the license verification. To do this, you will need a crack file that can modify the original executable file of NetTime Server and make it think that you have a valid license.

Now, go to the folder where you installed NetTime Server 3.04 (usually C:\Program Files\Net Time Server & Client) and rename the original nettime.exe file to something else (for example, nettime.bak). Then, copy the cracked nettime.exe file from the folder where you extracted the crack file and paste it into the same folder where you renamed the original nettime.exe file. Also, copy the nettime.ini file from the crack folder and paste it into the same folder.
 
You have successfully cracked NetTime Server 3.04 and can now use it without any limitations. To run it, double-click on the nettime.exe file or use the shortcut icon on your desktop or start menu.
