The Helmsman Saga is a series of eight books that span the life and career of Wilf Brim, a low-born officer who rises through the ranks of the Imperial Fleet and becomes a hero of the Empire. The series is set in a far-future galaxy where humans are divided into two factions: the Empire and the League of Dark Stars. The Empire is a feudal society ruled by an emperor and a nobility, while the League is a totalitarian regime that seeks to overthrow the Empire and enslave its people.
 
The series begins with The Helmsman, where Brim is assigned to the starship Defiant, a decrepit vessel that is part of a suicide mission against the League. Brim manages to survive and distinguish himself in battle, earning the respect of his crew and the admiration of Princess Margot, the emperor's daughter. The series continues with Galactic Convoy, The Trophy, The Mercenaries, The Defenders, The Siege, The Defiance, and The Turning Tide. Each book features a new adventure and a new challenge for Brim and his allies, as they face enemies both within and outside the Empire.
 
The Helmsman Saga is a classic example of space opera, a subgenre of science fiction that focuses on interstellar warfare, romance, and adventure. The series combines elements of military science fiction, such as realistic battles, tactics, and weapons, with elements of fantasy, such as exotic aliens, ancient mysteries, and parallel universes. The series also explores themes such as loyalty, honor, courage, friendship, and love.
